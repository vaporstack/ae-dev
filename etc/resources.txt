THE BIG 4:

•	After Effects CS6 Scripting Guide
	https://blogs.adobe.com/aftereffects/files/2012/06/After-Effects-CS6-Scripting-Guide.pdf?file=2012/06/After-Effects-CS6-Scripting-Guide.pdf
	Obviously the most important document.  Covers all available methods and objects.
	A navigable HTML version would be nice (adobe? check out Nuke's documentation)

•	JavaScript Tools Guide
	https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/1953/8974/2h/wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/products/indesign/pdfs/JavaScriptToolsGuide_CS5.pdf
	Scripting guide for the entire adobe suit.  This covers things not After Effects specific, like the File and Folder objects. ScriptUI panels, etc etc.

•	JavaScript Pocket Reference
	http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Pocket-Reference-OReilly/dp/1449316859
	Light reading for the subway (ha).  Get into nitty gritty details of the language.

•	JavaScript: The Good Parts
	http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742
	Especially useful for AE people.  Figure out why 20 + 20 sometimes == 2020.

(Supplementary)

•	After Effects Expression Basics
	The differences between what is accessible via expression and script are nuanced and ever changing, this is all expression-specific material.

•	ExtendScript Toolkit sucks.  Use it as infrequently as possible.  Enable autoreload of changed documents, set a monospaced font for fucks sake, use a different code editor, and save often.

•	Javascript Module Patterns
	On designing reusable code.
	http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html

•	JSLint
	There's a whole chapter about it in JS: the good parts.  There's a reason.  The linter of choice seems to change but node.js has the meanest one I've found so far.
	(edit) the community has apparently switched over to JSHint.

•	ScriptUI for dummies
	because when it comes to ScriptUI, we're all dummies

•	git / Mercurial
	Version control.  Learn it, use it, love it.
